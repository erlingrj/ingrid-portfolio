Hello! I am an Norwegian architect called Ingrid. 


![This is me](/img/ingrid.jpg)

I graduated from the Norwegian
University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
in May 2024 with a masters degree in architecture. I
have a strong passion for regenerative design,
implemented with a special focus to materials
and aesthetics. As an architect I’m curious
and exploratory, always eager to learn new
things. My goal is to create architecture that
promotes a more sustainable lifestyle and
better solutions for the future on a societal
and environmental level.

I enjoy challenging the expected and to
explore alternative pathways. My design
strategy is based on the principle ’making is
thinking,’ which brings joy and creativity to
the process. Sharing this creativity with others
and seeing it culminate in completed projects
is something I value.

In my free time, I lead an active life. I lived on
a sailboat for some years and spent two years
in Italy dyring my studies. Living on a sailboat
had its challenges, but it provided a unique
experience and education about alternative
ways of living. Apart from sailing, I practice
yoga, oil painting, and spend much time
in nature.
