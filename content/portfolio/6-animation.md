## animation movie

![](/img/animation/sketch2.jpg) 

While on my exchange year in Italy, I enrolled in an architectural representation course that culminated in creating a film. The narrative is about the juxtaposition of loneliness in a bustling city or building and the solace one can find within that solitude.

The movie is a frame-by-frame animation and I used Adobe Photoshop to make it. The project was done in collaboration with Eir Petursdottir and Elisabeth Otte.
