## otrava!


In 2023, I designed a photography book by author Camilla Pavlikova titled Otrava!, a Slovak word meaning "troublemaker." The book explores themes of identity, family, upbringing, and marginalization. It’s a deeply personal work, featuring photos from the author's childhood, some from her mother’s childhood, and childhood drawings, alongside more recent analog photographs taken by Camilla herself. These images are interwoven with short texts and personal stories from the author's life. The book is available for purchase at Tronsmo in Oslo or directly through Camilla Pavlikova
