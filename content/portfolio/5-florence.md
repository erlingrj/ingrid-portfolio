## historical museum in Florence

![](/img/florence/main.jpg) 

During my exchange year in Florence, I took a cource where we were faced with the task of designing a historical museum in a narrow street in the historical center of Florence. I worked on this assignment together with Eir Petursdottir and Hanna Ditfurth. We took inspiration from the materials in the surroundings and chose a monolithic facade made of white Carrara marble. This marble matches the one found on the Medici Chapel, located just 50 meters further down the same street.

The museum is small, so it employs a limited selection of materials, focusing on typical colors and materials from Florence. We chose to use a wine-red vinyl floor and metal, white marble, and a cream-colored finish on the walls and ceiling.

The facade facing the street is covered with marble slabs, while the facade towards the courtyard incorporates a curtain wall system with three layers of glass. The glass has a reflective surface to enhance the sense of space and tranquillity in the courtyard. The basement is designated for temporary exhibitions and features skylights that allow natural light from the courtyard.
