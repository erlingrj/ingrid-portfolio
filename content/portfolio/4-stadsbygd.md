Shared farms, re-use of unused farm buildings and a local currency gives the village character and strenghtens the community.

### the strip

The Strip is a socio-ecological experimental area where community and sharing are core values. It is a street where consisting of shared farmbuildings and yards where those who live there contribute activley to the community. To make the Strip, old and unused farmbuildings from the area are moved there. Each yard consists of several households, with one or more shared functions like laundery or a workshop. On the Strip, property bounderies are removed so that new yards can easily be created. 

The Strip has a clear beginning and ening, marked with an portal. The road is also painted red to differentiate further. To live there, one have to apply, and the prices are regulated to ensure a dynamic and diverse population and to avoid speculation. The Strip is a tool for testing out ways to live more regenerative. 

The local currency "Fospæng" is an important feature of The Strip. Fospæng is an initiative to encourge and strenghten local businesses. It gives identity to the area as well as beeing an incentive to start a business and a way of utilizing the resources that are there (the people). It is a means on the way to a self-sustaining and regenerative community.
