### Life in "Death Valley"

As a part of the course "AAR4466 Large Buildings" I designed, together with  Una Nakstad and Eir Petursdottir, a proposal for the new architecture, art and design campus at NTNU. 

 Our strategy involved relocating
the new building to ‘Dødens Dal’
(Death Valley), instead of the original site.
Dødens Dal, which is an extension of the
northern part of Gløshaugen and the
plateau, offers significant potential for
increased utilization.

The aim of the project is to breathe new
life into this part of the campus, making it
a crucial university avenue while utilizing
the vast green spaces for creative work.
The building positions itself in the existing
grid at Gløshaugen, serving as a natural
endpoint to the plateau.

Each of the three academic disciplines has
its dedicated building, linked by a shared
underground “laboratory” that houses a
large workshop for interdisciplinary creative
exploration. The ground floor includes
a cafeteria, library, and a broad exhibition
corridor where all disciplines can display
their projects, inspiring fellow students on
their way to classes.
