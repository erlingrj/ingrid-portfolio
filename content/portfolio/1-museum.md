### rammed earth art museum 

During my fifth year, I enrolled in the course
"AAR4721 Architecture and the City", delving into
civic building design within the context of urban
planning projects. Our specific task was to design
an art museum in Trondheim, a topic that was
part of an ongoing debate due to the existing
museum’s challenges with space shortage.

Collaborating in pairs, my partner, Casper Kragholm, and I approached
the assignment with a critical question:
is the conventional practice of centralizing art
museums in new, huge, standalone structures
outdated? By advocating for adaptive reuse of
the existing building, rather than dismissing the
current museum, we therefore proposed upgrading
the existing structure while incorporating a
new underground gallery.

Considering Trondheim’s clay-rich ground, our
design incorporated rammed earth walls. These
earth rooms served as spaces for pause and
contemplation, strategically positioned in-between
the more conventional white cube exhibition
spaces. Acknowledging the potential
overwhelming nature of navigating a museum,
we recognized the value of incorporating these
pause areas to offer visitors a reset of the mind.
The rammed earth rooms are the only ones with
natural light, and we let the light, and the beautiful
walls play the main character of these rooms.
