## Protector of the Sea

In the scenic Puglia region of southern Italy, the ancient coastal towers stand as remnants of a fortification system. Torre Rinalda, a prominent 16th-century limestone tower near Lecce, exemplifies this defense mechanism. Participants were tasked, in collaboration with the Municipality of Lecce, to reimagine Torre Rinalda — breathing new life into it as a revitalized landmark with a renewed sense of place, while also transforming its dormant spaces into vibrant public
areas for communal engagement and observation.

Rinalda’s former military tower is reimagined as the ‘Protector of the Sea’ to address the threats of rising sea levels, pollution, and overfishing. Our vision was not only to rejuvenates the tower as a tourist attraction for Lecce but positions it as a symbol of oceanic conservation. This beacon of awareness therefore serves as an educational and communal hub.

The ground floor hosts an immersive art installation reflecting recent
oceanic research. The top floor, with
a polycarbonate roof made from
recycled ocean plastic, extends the
interior and doubles as a community
space for lectures, art shows, or film
nights against the tower’s medieval
walls.

Corten steel ramps offer a scenic
walk to the tower with expansive
Adriatic views. This revitalized tower
not only boosts Lecce’s tourism
but stands as a sentinel for ocean
conservation. We envision a future
network of such beacon towers
championing sea protection.
