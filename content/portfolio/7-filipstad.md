## aesthetic guide for filipstad in oslo

![](/img/filipstad/cover.jpg) 

I participated in ‘Prosjekt Filipstad’ alongside
students from across the country,
spanning the disciplines of architecture,
design, and urban and regional planning.
The project’s objective was to devise an aesthetic
guide for the Filipstad district in Oslo,
ensuring sustainable development with a
focus on aesthetics.

Collaborative partners included KOI Fargestudio
and Multiconsult. The outcome was a
comprehensive color and material palette,
accompanied by a set of principles and
guidelines for facade design. I was the lead
student architect and responsible for communication
with the media. I also did most
of the illustration work for the architecture
chapters, as well as the cover image.

As a result of the project, I had an article
published in the norwegian newspaper
Morgenbladet. A link to the article is located on the "media" page.
